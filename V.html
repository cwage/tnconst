    <blockquote>
      <p><a name="1"></a>&sect; 1. Power to impeach</p>

      <p>The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>

      <p><a name="2"></a>&sect; 2. Trial; conviction</p>

      <p>All impeachments shall be tried by the Senate. When sitting for that purpose the Senators shall be upon oath or affirmation, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or if he be on trial, the Senior Associate Judge, shall preside over them. No person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators sworn to try the officer impeached.</p>

      <p><a name="3"></a>&sect; 3. Prosecution</p>

      <p>The House of Representatives shall elect from their own body three members, whose duty it shall be to prosecute impeachments. No impeachment shall be tried until the Legislature shall have adjourned sine die, when the Senate shall proceed to try such impeachment.</p>

      <p><a name="4"></a>&sect; 4. Persons subject to impeachment</p>

      <p>The Governor, Judges of the Supreme Court, Judges of Inferior Courts, Chancellors, Attorneys for the State, Treasurer, Comptroller and Secretary of State, shall be liable to impeachment, whenever they may, in the opinion of the House of Representatives, commit any crime in their official capacity which may require disqualification; but judgment shall only extend to removal from office, and disqualification to fill any office thereafter. The party shall, nevertheless, be liable to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law. The Legislature now has, and shall continue to have, power to relieve from the penalties imposed, any person disqualified from holding office by the judgment of a Court of Impeachment.</p>

      <p><a name="5"></a>&sect; 5. Conviction of crimes; officers subject to removal from office</p>

      <p>Justices of the Peace, and other civil officers, not hereinbefore mentioned, for crimes or misdemeanors in office, shall be liable to indictment in such courts as the Legislature may direct; and upon conviction, shall be removed from office by said court, as if found guilty on impeachment; and shall be subject to such other punishment as may be prescribed by law.</p>
