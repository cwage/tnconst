      <p>That all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; for the advancement of those ends they have at all times, an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper.</p>

      <p><a name="a1s2" id="a1s2"></a>&sect; 2. Doctrine of non-resistance</p>

      <p>That government being instituted for the common benefit, the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.</p>

      <p>That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.</p>

      <p><a name="a1s4" id="a1s4"></a>&sect; 4. Political or religious test</p>

      <p><a name="a1s5" id="a1s5"></a>&sect; 5. Elections and suffrage</p>

      <p>The elections shall be free and equal, and the right of suffrage, as hereinafter declared, shall never be denied to any person entitled thereto, except upon conviction by a jury of some infamous crime, previously ascertained and declared by law, and judgment thereon by court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

      <p><a name="8"></a>&sect; 8. Deprivation of life, liberty or property under law; due process</p>

      <p>That no man shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.</p>

      <p><a name="9"></a>&sect; 9. Rights of accused</p>

      <p>That in all criminal prosecutions, the accused hath the right to be heard by himself and his counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof, to meet the witnesses face to face, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and in prosecutions by indictment or presentment, a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the County in which the crime shall have been committed, and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself.</p>

      <p><a name="10"></a>&sect; 10. Double jeopardy</p>

      <p>That no person shall, for the same offence, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.</p>

      <p><a name="11"></a>&sect; 11. Ex post facto laws</p>

      <p>That laws made for the punishment of acts committed previous to the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are contrary to the principles of a free Government; wherefore no Ex post facto law shall be made.</p>

      <p><a name="12"></a>&sect; 12. Corruption of blood; forfeiture of estates</p>

      <p>That no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate. The estate of such persons as shall destroy their own lives shall descend or vest as in case of natural death. If any person be killed by casualty, there shall be no forfeiture in consequence thereof.</p>

      <p>That all prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offences, when the proof is evident, or the presumption great. And the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in case of rebellion or invasion, the General Assembly shall declare the public safety requires it.</p>

      <p><a name="16"></a>&sect; 16. Excessive bail or fines; cruel and unusual punishment</p>

      <p>That excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.</p>

      <p><a name="17"></a>&sect; 17. Remedies in courts, suits against state</p>

      <p>That all courts shall be open; and every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial, or delay.

      <p>That the printing presses shall be free to every person to examine the proceedings of the Legislature; or of any branch or officer of the government, and no law shall ever be made to restrain the right thereof. The free communication of thoughts and opinions, is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write, and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty. But in prosecutions for the publication of papers investigating the official conduct of officers, or men in public capacity, the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and in all indictments for libel, the jury shall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the court, as in other criminal cases.</p>

      <p>That the citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble together for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to those invested with the powers of government for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by address or remonstrance.</p>

      <p><a name="24"></a>&sect; 24. Militia</p>

      <p>That the sure and certain defense of a free people, is a well regulated militia; and, as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to freedom, they ought to be avoided as far as the circumstances and safety of the community will admit; and that in all cases the military shall be kept in strict subordination to the civil authority.</p>

      <p><a name="25"></a>&sect; 25. Martial law</p>

      <p>That no citizen of this State, except such as are employed in the army of the United States, or militia in actual service, shall be subjected to punishment under the martial or military law. That martial law, in the sense of the unrestricted power of military officers, or others, to dispose of the persons, liberties or property of the citizen, is inconsistent with the principles of free government, and is not confided to any department of the government of this State.</p>

      <p><a name="26"></a>&sect; 26. Weapons; right to bear arms</p>

      <p>That the citizens of this State have a right to keep and to bear arms for their common defense; but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime.</p>

      <p><a name="27"></a>&sect; 27. Quartering soldiers</p>

      <p>That no soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war, but in a manner prescribed by law.</p>

      <p><a name="28"></a>&sect; 28. Military service; compelling to bear arms</p>

      <p>That no citizen of this State shall be compelled to bear arms, provided he will pay an equivalent, to be ascertained by law.</p>

      <p><a name="29"></a>&sect; 29. Mississippi river; navigation</p>

      <p>That an equal participation in the free navigation of the Mississippi, is one of the inherent rights of the citizens of this State; it cannot, therefore, be conceded to any prince, potentate, power, person or persons whatever.</p>

      <p><a name="30"></a>&sect; 30. Hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors</p>

      <p>That no hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors, shall ever be granted or conferred in this State.</p>
